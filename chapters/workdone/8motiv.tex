\section{Manufacturing at Motiv}

The exploration of manufacturing practices during the internship provided valuable insights into the real-world application of innovative design and production methodologies. Manufacturing was conducted at GNEX, which is hosted at Motiv due to the availability of advanced machinery such as laser cutters, 3D printers, and woodworking machines located at Motiv.

Motiv, a prominent player in the technology industry, is committed to cutting-edge technology and sustainability, as exemplified by its adoption of advanced manufacturing techniques and materials. These practices align with the principles of Industry 4.0, characterized by the integration of digital technologies, automation, and data-driven decision-making into manufacturing operations. This approach streamlines production, enhances product quality, and reduces time-to-market.

Moreover, Motiv places a strong emphasis on sustainability and eco-conscious manufacturing practices, consistent with contemporary trends in corporate responsibility. By incorporating recycled and environmentally friendly materials, Motiv contributes to the reduction of carbon footprint and resource depletion.
