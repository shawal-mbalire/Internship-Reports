\section{Testing E-Waste for Functional Components}

This subsection offers a detailed insight into a crucial facet of the e-waste repurposing project undertaken during our internship: the systematic and meticulous testing of collected electronic components to identify functional elements suitable for reuse. This phase of the project was instrumental in ensuring that only viable and operational parts from MTN's electronic waste inventory were integrated into the construction of the personal computer system.

\subsection{The Testing Process}

The testing phase commenced with the careful disassembly of discarded electronic devices, a process that allowed us to extract a plethora of components, including processors, memory modules, graphics cards, and storage drives. Each component, upon extraction, underwent a testing by plugging into a minimal system to confirm functionality. This process was repeated for every component, ensuring that each one was thoroughly tested and evaluated.

Components that exhibited any signs of damage, wear, or malfunction were meticulously documented and set aside for proper disposal or recycling, in strict adherence to ethical e-waste management practices. Conversely, components that unequivocally met the stringent operational standards we had set were considered prime candidates for inclusion in the personal computer assembly. Compatibility between selected components was another pivotal consideration to ensure a seamless and reliable system.

\subsection{Challenges and Adaptability}

The testing process presented its own set of challenges, primarily stemming from the remarkable variability in component types, brands, and ages found within MTN's electronic waste collection.The systems would range from the 90s Toshiba monitors to 2010's dell monitors. All ram modules ranging from DDR! through DDR4. This inherent diversity necessitated the utilization of a diverse set of testing methodologies. However, these challenges were met with a spirit of collaboration among team members and the invaluable guidance provided by experienced mentors. This collective effort proved instrumental in overcoming testing hurdles effectively and efficiently.

\subsection{Success and Implications}

The successful testing of e-waste for functional components was pivotal in ensuring the quality and reliability of the constructed personal computer system. Beyond this immediate accomplishment, this phase of the project underscored several critical lessons. It emphasized the importance of technical skills, meticulous attention to detail, and the significant role of ethical e-waste management practices in the pursuit of environmentally responsible initiatives.

In conclusion, the "Testing E-Waste for Functional Components" phase of our internship project not only contributed to the overall success of the e-waste repurposing initiative but also served as a testament to our commitment to sustainability and responsible electronics reuse. It reinforces the essential role that conscientious assessment plays in the realm of environmentally responsible practices, highlighting the broader implications of our work.
